This project consists of two parts: PyBank and PyPoll, each part consisting of one python file, a resources folder containing a single csv file and an analysis folder containing a single txt file providing an analysis of its paired csv.

PyBank analyzes monthly profit and loss data, providing the total number of months data is provided for, the net profit during that entire time period, the average change from month to month in, and the date and amount of the greastest profit and greatest loss.

PyPoll analyzes voting records, determining the total number of votes, each unique candidate and the number and percentage of votes they received, and determining the victor based on popular votes.
